# Pizza Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast pizza sales based on various factors such as date, time, pizza size, and category. The goal is to provide insights into sales patterns and optimize inventory management for a pizza business. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of over 48,000 records of pizza orders. The implemented machine learning model, a Random Forest Regressor, achieves an R-squared score of 0.88, indicating strong predictive performance. The project leverages Python, scikit-learn, and pandas for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks, code files, and documentation for reproducibility and transparency.
